    "A1": "The Arrival of the Heroes - The scouts of the King couldn't believe their eyes. Finally! Prince Thorald had returned and had gathered the bravest Heroes of Andor. In part 1 of the beginners game the Heroes must complete 4 tasks before the Adventure actually begins. The tasks are: 1. At least one Hero must flip a fog token 2. At least one Hero must buy a strenght point from a merchant. To accomplish this he needs 2 gold. 3. One Hero must use a well. 4. At the End one Hero must enter the castle. All tasks can be completed by stepping on the respective spaces. The Hero with the lowest rank (see Hero table) is the starting player and puts his player token onto the rooster symbol within the sunrise box and begins the day.",
    "A2": "The river can not be entered. He can only be crossed by using the bridges. The bridges do not count as spaces and will not be counted as such while moving. Every Hero has a time limit of 7 hours. Therefor you should discuss your steps cooperatively who completes which task. Part 1 of the beginners game ends: a) if a Hero ends his move on the castle. (space 0) or b) if all Heroes have used their time limit of 7 hours. If all tasks have been completed you have completed part 1 of the beginners game. Please proceed reading with article 4 on page 2 of the starters manual.",
    "B1": "Times of peace in Andor had always lasted only a few years. The great King Brandur was worried and had sent his son, Prince Thorald, to ask for help from all parts of the country. This legend began on a foggy morning, when the first hero reached the Rietburg. Equipment: Each hero now gets 1 strength point added. 4 gold are distributed randomly among the group. You decide together who gets how much. A hero standing on a field with a merchant symbol (fields 18, 57 and 71) can buy additional strength points for 2 gold each. However, this is not possible in passing. Fields where there are creatures can be entered and passed without danger. Only heroes trigger a fight, never the creatures. Legend Objective: It is the task of the heroes to defeat the creatures before they reach the castle.",
    "B2": "To prevent too many creatures from entering the castle, the heroes must attack it. From now on, a hero always chooses between two options in his turn: Running and Fighting To attack a creature, the hero must stand in the same square as the creature. When combat occurs, read aloud the instructions on the combat board. Each hero should now look at his special ability again (see the hero board). The hero who is on the castle starts the new day.",
    "C": "The creatures tried to storm the castle. When a creature enters the castle, it is immediately placed on a golden shield next to the castle. The legend is lost if there is no free shield for a creature entering the castle. How many golden shields there are depends on the number of players.Even though the heroes were of different backgrounds, they soon realized that they could only stop the creatures together. If several heroes stand together with a creature in one field, they can fight together (the archer also from an adjacent field). This makes them much stronger. Then read the card Fighting together aloud",
    "D": "The king's servants brought bad news: More creatures had appeared. Now place Gors on the fields 8, 15, 43, 48, 53. General deployment rule (applies to all creatures): If there is already a creature on one of these squares, place the new creature from the occupied square along the arrow into the adjacent square. Note: Creatures never activate fog tiles or well tiles.",
    "F": "One of the heroes met fishermen on the run. A skral on the river had attacked them. It had been a long time since such creatures had been seen in Andor. What did their return mean? Now place a skral on field 32. The fight against skral works the same way as against gors. But skrals are much stronger. They have 6 strength points and 6 will points and bring a reward of 4 gold/will points (see also the creature display on the game board). Skrale move at sunrise, after all Gors have been moved (see symbols on the sunrise tile). They also move along the arrows. Don't forget: Defeated creatures are always placed on square 80. The narrator immediately moves 1 space on the legend bar!",
    "H1": "A message from King Brandur reached the heroes: My friends, I thank you for your help. The situation is serious. The suspension bridge over the river has been destroyed. The suspension bridge is covered with the red X and can no longer be walked on. Fields 16 and 48 are now no longer adjacent. A Gor on field 48 simply stops at sunrise. I have written a warning to our allies, the Keepers of the Tree of Songs. You must succeed in delivering this letter. Now place a parchment on square 5. A hero entering this square or already standing there can pick up the parchment and place it on one of the small storage squares on his hero board. However, you can't do this while passing by. Task: The parchment must be taken to the Tree of Songs (square 57) before the narrator reaches square N of the Legend Track. If the parchment is on square 57, the legend ends prematurely and the narrator is immediately placed on square N.",
    "H2": "Important: If the parchment or the hero carrying the parchment is in the same hex with a creature, the legend is immediately lost. This also applies if the hero with the parchment would pass a square with a creature. I fear that the creatures will try to intercept the letter! the king concluded his message. Places Gors on the squares 19, 36, 56 and Skrale on 54 and 64. Do not forget: The parchment bearer must be careful not to stand on a square where a creature is moving at sunrise! Discard items: A hero may discard the parchment (or gold, and in later legends, other items) on a square he is standing on - but not in passing! There it can be picked up by the same hero. In this way, two heroes standing in the same field can exchange or give away any number of items and gold. However, strength points and will points cannot be exchanged or given away! If you have successfully passed the legend or failed early, read the card N aloud",
